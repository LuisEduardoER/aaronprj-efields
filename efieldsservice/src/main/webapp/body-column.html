                       Trading stocks. You hear that phrase all the time, although it really is wrong – you don't trade stocks like baseball cards (I'll trade you 100 IBMs for 100 Intels).

                       <b>Stock</b> is a piece of ownership of a company. When a company needs to acquire  extra money to help grow the business, they can sell some or all of the  ownership of the company in the form of stocks. So if you were to buy  100% of a company's stock, you would own the whole company. If you own  enough stock you also have some decision-making power within the  company. Buying stock is a very popular form of investing.
